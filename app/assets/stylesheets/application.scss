//  This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
//  listed below.

//  Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
//  or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.

//  You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
//  compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
//  files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
//  It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

// = require animate.css/animate.css
